# open-index

A common modern javaScript convention is to have a single `index.js` file in a folder that exports a default file with the implementation. This extensions will automatically open the file that is found in that `index.js` anytime it is opened.

## Requirements

The extension is quite limited and can currently only find files when they are in the format `export { default } from 'my-file'`;

Supported languages for the index files are javaScript and Typescript
